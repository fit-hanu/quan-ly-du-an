Chapter Overview

Chapter 3 describes the five project management process groups and how they relate to the ten knowledge areas. It also describes how organizations can develop their own information technology project management methodologies to help manage projects in their unique environments. A large part of this chapter describes two detailed case studies to show how to apply the project management process groups (initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing) to an information technology project. The first is based on a predictive approach, and the second uses an agile approach. Differences in using the two approaches are highlighted. The case studies use many of the templates provided on the companion Web site and listed at the end of this chapter.

 

Chapter Objectives

•        Describe the five project management process groups, the typical level of activity for each, and the interactions among them

•        Understand how the project management process groups relate to the project management knowledge areas

•        Discuss how organizations develop information technology (IT) project management methodologies to meet their needs

•        Review a case study of an organization applying the project management process groups to manage an IT project, describe outputs of each process group, and understand the contribution that effective initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing make to project success

•        Review a same case study of a the same project managed with an agile and compare the key differences between an agile approach and a predictive approach

•        Describe several templates for creating documents for each process group
